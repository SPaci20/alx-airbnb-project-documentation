Technical and Functional Requirements
This document details the functional and non-functional requirements for three core backend features of the Airbnb Clone project: User Authentication, Property Management, and the Booking System.

1. User Authentication and Profile Management (P1.0)
Feature Summary
Allows all users (Guest, Host, Admin) to securely register, log in, manage their profile details, and establish their session for authorized actions.

1.1. API Endpoints
Endpoint

HTTP Method

Description

Authentication Required

/api/v1/users/register

POST

Creates a new user account.

No

/api/v1/users/login

POST

Authenticates user and returns an access token.

No

/api/v1/users/me

GET

Retrieves the authenticated user's profile details.

Yes (Token)

/api/v1/users/me

PUT

Updates the authenticated user's profile information.

Yes (Token)

1.2. Input/Output Specifications
Action

Input Data

Output Data

Register

first_name, last_name, email, password, role (default: guest)

user_id, email, role, auth_token

Login

email, password

user_id, auth_token

Update Profile

first_name, last_name, phone_number

Full updated user object

1.3. Validation Rules
Email: Must be unique across all users. Must be a valid email format (e.g., matching RFC 5322).

Password: Must be a minimum of 8 characters. Must be hashed using a strong, one-way algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before storage.

Role: Must be restricted to the defined ENUM values: guest, host, or admin.

1.4. Performance Criteria
Latency: Registration and login endpoints must respond within ≤100 ms for 95% of requests.

Security: Password hashing and token generation must use industry-standard cryptographic libraries.

2. Property Listing Management (P2.0)
Feature Summary
Enables Hosts to create and manage property listings, and provides comprehensive search functionality for Guests to find available properties.

2.1. API Endpoints
Endpoint

HTTP Method

Description

Authentication Required

/api/v1/properties

POST

Creates a new property listing.

Yes (Host Token)

/api/v1/properties/{id}

GET

Retrieves details for a specific property.

No

/api/v1/properties

GET

Searches and lists properties based on query parameters.

No

/api/v1/properties/{id}

PUT

Updates an existing property listing.

Yes (Host Token - must be owner)

2.2. Input/Output Specifications
Action

Input Data

Output Data

Create Listing

name, description, location, price_per_night

Full property object with generated property_id

Search Listings

Query parameters: location, min_price, max_price

Array of summarized property objects

2.3. Validation Rules
Host Access: Only users with the host role can create or update listings. Update requests must verify the authenticated user is the property's host_id.

Required Fields: name, description, location, and price_per_night are all mandatory (NOT NULL).

Price: price_per_night must be a positive decimal value (>0).

2.4. Performance Criteria
Concurrency: The Search endpoint must handle 100 concurrent requests with minimal degradation.

Latency: Complex search queries (multiple filters) must return a response within ≤500 ms for 90% of requests.

Indexing: Database indexes must be utilized on location and pricepernight for query optimization.

3. Booking System (P3.0)
Feature Summary
Manages the creation of reservation requests by Guests, availability checks, total price calculation, and status updates handled by Hosts.

3.1. API Endpoints
Endpoint

HTTP Method

Description

Authentication Required

/api/v1/bookings

POST

Submits a new booking reservation request.

Yes (Guest Token)

/api/v1/bookings/{id}

GET

Retrieves details for a specific booking.

Yes (Guest/Host/Admin Token)

/api/v1/bookings/{id}/status

PUT

Updates the status of a pending booking (e.g., to confirmed or canceled).

Yes (Host/Admin Token)

3.2. Input/Output Specifications
Action

Input Data

Output Data

Request Booking

property_id, start_date, end_date

booking_id, total_price, status (pending), created_at

Update Status

Path param: booking_id. Body: status (confirmed/canceled)

Full updated booking object

3.3. Validation Rules
Date Validity: start_date must be before end_date. Both dates must be in the future relative to the current time.

Availability Check: The system must check the BOOKING records (D3) for the requested property_id. If any confirmed booking dates overlap with the request, the booking must be rejected.

Status Update: Only Hosts or Admins are allowed to change the status of a booking they own/manage. The status field must be one of the defined ENUM values (pending, confirmed, canceled).

3.4. Performance Criteria
Atomicity: The booking creation process (which includes availability check, price calculation, and record insertion) must be handled as a single, atomic transaction and complete within ≤300 ms.

Integrity: The system must ensure no overlapping confirmed bookings can exist for the same property.

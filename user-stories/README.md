User Stories
This directory contains the user-stories.md file, which translates the core use cases and interactions of the Airbnb Clone project into actionable user stories.

Each user story follows the standard format: "As a [Role], I want to [Action] so that [Benefit]," providing a clear, user-centric view of the system's required functionality.
